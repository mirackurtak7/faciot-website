This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Analytics

This project includes optional Google Analytics 4 integration.

1. Create a GA4 property and obtain your Measurement ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`).
2. Create a `.env.local` file at the project root and set:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` is not set, analytics scripts will not be injected.
